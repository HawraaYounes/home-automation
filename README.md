Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [React js library](https://reactjs.org/). React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) which is widely used relational database management system (RDBMS). MySQL is free and open-source. MySQL is ideal for both small and large applications.
- For backend, the project uses [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/). Laravel is an open-source PHP framework, which is robust and easy to understand. It follows a model-view-controller design pattern.
