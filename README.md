Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the InHome uses:

- This project uses the [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/).React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), which is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle that is based on structured query language (SQL). 
- For backend, the app uses the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework, , which is robust and easy to understand. It follows a model-view-controller design pattern..
- For realtime messages,the app uses [Pusher API](https://pusher.com/), a hosted API service which makes adding real-time data and functionality to web and mobile applications seamless.
